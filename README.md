This repo contains the code for our Matls 4ML3 Final Project.

For this project we will be predicting Republican vs. Democrat wins in different congressional districts.
Republican = 1
Democrat = 0

Data has been taken from [the Daily Kos](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XbUXnI9OyfAuhP5P3vWtMuGc5UJlrhXbzZo3AwMuHtk/edit#gid=2098782715)

By running the pop_data_cleaning.ipynb notebook, the file 'dataset.csv' will be generated which is the resulting dataset to be used for this study.

Census data was retrieved from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)
